##Code:
1. In class we bounced a particle between two side by side screens.  Bounce a particle between 4 screens arranged like so:

	-----------------
	|       |       |
	|   1   |   2   |
	|-------|-------|
	|       |       |
	|   3   |   4   |
	-----------------

Hint: It's possible to set a default position for the actual oF window by calling ofSetWindowPosition().

2. Use Duration (duration.cc) to coreograph a looping 10 second animation.  If you include sound, make sure it's a .wav or .aiff.  When you submit these, include your Duration project file and any sounds if you choose to use them (duration does not include them by default).  The projects save to Documents/Duration by default.

##Advanced:
1. Copy your first example, and make a version animating multiple attributes.  Color, rotation etc etc.
